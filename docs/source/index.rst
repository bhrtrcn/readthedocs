Welcome to the ISB-CGC Documentation on Read the Docs!

Contained within the documentation are descriptions of ISB-CGC features along with guides and tips for exploring data sets hosted on the Google Cloud Platform.

The ISB-CGC aims to serve the needs of a broad range of cancer researchers ranging from scientists or clinicians who prefer to use an interactive web-based application to access and explore the rich TCGA, TARGET, CCLE, and COSMIC datasets, to computational scientists who want to write their own custom scripts using languages such as R or Python, accessing the data through APIs, and to algorithm developers who wish to spin up thousands of virtual machines to analyze hundreds of terabytes of sequence data.
