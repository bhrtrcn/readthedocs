ISB-CGC Web Interface
*********************

The documentation contained in this section is for the `ISB-CGC web interface <https://isb-cgc.appspot.com/>`_. Over time we will be updating and enhancing this web interface based on your feedback.  
We welcome your ideas and needs.  Please use this `link <https://groups.google.com/a/isb-cgc.org/forum/#!newtopic/feedback>`_ to provide them.

Sharing Cohorts between Web-App and APIs
########################################
Cohorts are one of the central concepts that researchers use when analyzing large datasets. Cohorts can be created either in the Web-App or via the ISB-CGC REST API. What may not be as clear is that cohorts created by one of the systems can be viewed and used in the other. In other words, you can create a cohort using the API and use it in the webapp or you can create a cohort in the webapp and use it in the API. This can give researchers significant flexibility in creating and sharing their cohorts.

Choosing a Web Browser
######################
The Web Application was optimized for use with the Google Chrome web browser.  Most of the functionality should work with recent versions 
of other web browsers (e.g. Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer).  If you find an issue and you are not using Chrome, please
try using Chrome to see if the issue appears to be browser-specific.

Web-App Time Zone
#################
Also please note the system is set in Pacific time, so if you see some inconsistencies with the time in the workbooks or cohorts you generated, it could be due to this.
