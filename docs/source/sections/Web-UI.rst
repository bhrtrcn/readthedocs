ISB-CGC Web Interface
*********************

The documentation contained in this section is for the `ISB-CGC web interface <https://isb-cgc.appspot.com/>`_.

Over time we will be updating and enhancing this web interface based on your feedback.  
We welcome your ideas and needs.  Please use this `link <https://groups.google.com/a/isb-cgc.org/forum/#!newtopic/feedback>`_ to provide them.

The data that is being manipulated with the Web Application is the same data that is available through the programmatic APIs.  
Details describing how to access these data are provided in detail in specific documentation sections elsewhere in the documentation.

The Web Application was optimized for use with the Google Chrome web browser.  Most of the functionality should work with recent versions 
of other web browsers (e.g. Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer).  If you find an issue and you are not using Chrome, please
try using Chrome to see if the issue appears to be browser-specific.

Also please note the system is set in Pacific time, so if you see some inconsistencies with the time in the workbooks or cohorts you generated, it could be due to this.
