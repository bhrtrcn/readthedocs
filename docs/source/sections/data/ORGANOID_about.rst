About the Pancreas Cancer Organoid Profiling Program
---------------

The `Pancreas Cancer Organoid Profiling Program <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001611.v1.p1&phv=409128&phd=8002&pha=&pht=9158&phvf=&phdf=&phaf=&phtf=&dssp=1&consent=&temp=1>`_ contains data generated from a collection of patient-derived pancreatic normal and cancer organoids. 

About the Pancreas Cancer Organoid Profiling Data Set
--------------------

The data set includes whole-genome, targeted exome, and RNA sequencing data on organoids as well as matched tumor and normal tissues. This dataset is a valuable resource for pancreas cancer researchers, and those looking to compare primary tissue to organoid culture. The project identification in the GDC is `ORGANOID-PANCREATIC <https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/ORGANOID-PANCREATIC>`_.
