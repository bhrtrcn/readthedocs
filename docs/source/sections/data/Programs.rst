In recent years, the `National Cancer Institute <https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci>`_, in collaboration with other institutes within `NIH <https://www.nih.gov/>`_, has invested in the production and analysis of several large datasets. The ISB-CGC platform is funded by NCI in an effort to make these data more accessible and usable.

The initial goal of the `ISB-CGC <http://www.isb-cgc.org>`_ was to host the data produced by `The Cancer Genome Atlas <https://cancergenome.nih.gov/abouttcga>`_ (TCGA) program. The data has now expanded to include data sets from `Therapeutically Applicable Research To Generate Effective Treatments <https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target>`_ (TARGET) program (a pediatric cancer program) and `Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative <https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/cgci>`_ (CGCI).

Along with NCI Cancer Programs, ISB-CGC hosts several data sets from other programs such as COSMIC from the `Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute <http://www.sanger.ac.uk/>`_. We are always looking to add new data sets so if you have any suggestions or requests for additional data that you would like to see made available, please let us know (feedback@isb-cgc.org) and we will try to make that happen.
