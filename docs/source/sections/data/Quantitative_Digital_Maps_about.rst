The PCT SWATH Kidney Study is available at the `Proteomics Data Commons (PDC) <https://pdc.cancer.gov/pdc/>`_. 
ISB-CGC has procured data from this study through the PDC API.

Accessing the Quantitative digital maps of tissue biopsies data in Google BigQuery
------------------------------------------------

ISB-CGC has Quantitative digital maps of tissue biopsies clinical data stored in Google BigQuery tables. Information about these tables can be found using the `ISB-CGC BigQuery Table Search <https://isb-cgc.appspot.com/bq_meta_search/>`_ with Quantitative Digital Maps selected for filter PROGRAM. To learn more about this tool, see the `ISB-CGC BigQuery Table Search documentation <../BigQueryTableSearchUI.html>`_.

The GPRP tables are in project isb-cgc-bq. To learn more about how to view and query tables in the Google BigQuery console, see the `ISB-CGC BigQuery Tables documentation <../BigQuery.html>`_.

- Data set ``isb-cgc-bq.PG25730263`` contains the latest tables for each data type.
- Data set ``isb-cgc-bq.PG25730263_versioned`` contains previously released tables, as well as the most current table.
