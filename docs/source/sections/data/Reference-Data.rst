ISB-CGC Hosted Reference Data
#############################

ISB-CGC hosts reference data to facilitate working with TCGA and other program data tables. Google Cloud Life Sciences also hosts a variety of helpful reference datasets in BigQuery. Suggestions for more are welcome at feedback@isb-cgc.org.

For additional details about the ISB-CGC tables, please use the `BigQuery Table Search <https://isb-cgc.appspot.com/bq_meta_search/>`_ and select **Reference Database** under the **Category** filter. 

Genome Reference Data
=====================

Genome reference data that describes or annotates the human or other genomes. Gene set tables, such as Ensembl and GENCODE, can help find the genomic coordinates and identifiers for genes of interest. For example, to perform queries that join tables with gene-symbol-based data to tables with genomic-coordinate-based data or tables that use other gene identifiers.

Platform Reference Data
=======================

Some reference data is necessary to work with data generated by specific platforms such as the
Illumina DNA Methylation array. The `platform_reference data set <https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=isb-cgc&d=GTEx_v7&page=dataset>`_  contains information on the Illumina DNA Methylation Platform.
    
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1 
   
   * - Program/Source
     - Description
   * - GDC
     - * HG38 DNA Methylation - Most of the DNA Methylation data produced by the TCGA project was obtained using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 (aka 450k) BeadChip array.  Some of the earlier tumor types were assayed on the older, 27k array.
   * - Infinium
     - * `Illumina <https://www.illumina.com/>`_ DNA Methylation Annotation - Platform annotation information has been uploaded into BigQuery; each CpG locus is uniquely identified as described in this `technical note <http://www.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-marketing/documents/products/technotes/technote_cpg_loci_identification.pdf>`_ and this unique identifier can be used to look up and cross-reference data between the TCGA DNA methylation data table and the platform annotation table. 
   * - Cytoband/UCSC
     - * DNA Methylation Annotation Liftover to HG38 Coordinates - The original Illumina-provided CpG coordinates have been *"lifted over"* from hg19 to hg38.
     
     
Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project Data
=======================

The `GTEx_v7 data set <https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=isb-cgc&d=GTEx_v7&page=dataset>`_ contains tables with molecular and clinical data (gene read, gene expression, sample attributes, subject phenotype) loaded from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project Data Portal on November 2017. See the  `GTEx Portal <https://gtexportal.org/>`_ for more information.

University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) TOIL RNA-seq recompute project Data
=======================

The `Toil_recompute data set <https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=isb-cgc&d=Toil_recompute&page=dataset>`_ contains data made available by the UCSC TOIL RNA-seq recompute project. The goal of the project was to process ~20,000 RNA-seq samples to create a consistent meta-analysis of four datasets free of computational batch effects. This is best used to compare TCGA cohorts to TARGET or GTEx cohorts. For more details, see the `Zena Browser Data Pages <https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/>`_.
