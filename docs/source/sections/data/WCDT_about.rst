About the Genomic Characterization of Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer
---------------

The overarching goal of the Genomic Characterization of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer study is to illuminate molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance to therapeutic agents, and particularly androgen signaling inhibitors, in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

About the Genomic Characterization of Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Data
--------------------

WCDT data is available from the biopsies of castration-resistant prostate cancer metastases collected during the study. The data consists of 101 cases with over 202 whole-genome sequencing files and 792 RNA sequencing files consisting of 83TB of data. The project identification in the GDC Data Portal is `WCDT-MCRPC <https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/WCDT-MCRPC>`_.

Accessing Genomic Characterization of Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Data on the Cloud
--------------------------------

Besides accessing the files on the GDC Data Portal, you can also access them from the GDC Google Cloud Storage Bucket, which means that you donâ€™t need to download them to perform analysis. ISB-CGC stores the cloud file locations in tables in the ``isb-cgc.GDC_metadata`` data set in BigQuery.

- To access these metadata files, go to the Google BigQuery console.
- Perform SQL queries to find the WCDT files. Here is an example:

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT active.*, file_gdc_url
  FROM `isb-cgc.GDC_metadata.rel22_fileData_active` as active, `isb-cgc.GDC_metadata.rel22_GDCfileID_to_GCSurl` as GCSurl
  WHERE program_name = 'WCDT'
  AND active.file_gdc_id = GCSurl.file_gdc_id
