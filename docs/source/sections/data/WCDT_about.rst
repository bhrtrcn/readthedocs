About the WCDT
---------------

The overarching goal of the Genomic Characterization of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer study is to illuminate molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance to therapeutic agents, and particularly androgen signaling inhibitors, in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

About the WCDT Data
--------------------

Whole-genome and RNA sequencing data are available from the biopsies of castration-resistant prostate cancer metastases collected during the study. More information on this data set is available from the `GDC Portal <https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/WCDT-MCRPC>`_.

Data sets and tables available in BigQuery from ISB-CGC are explorable through the `BigQuery Table Search <https://isb-cgc.appspot.com/bq_meta_search/>`_. Files can be found within the ``isb-cgc.GDC_metadata`` tables in BigQuery.

The Data Use Agreement can be found `here <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001648.v1.p1>`_.
