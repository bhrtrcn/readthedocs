About the WCDT
---------------

The overarching goal of the Genomic Characterization of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer study is to illuminate molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance to therapeutic agents, and particularly androgen signaling inhibitors, in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

About the WCDT Data
--------------------

WCDT data is available from the biopsies of castration-resistant prostate cancer metastases collected during the study. The data consists of 101 cases with over 202 whole-genome sequencing files and 792 RNA sequencing files consisting of 83TB of data. The project identification in the GDC is `HCMI-CMDC <https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/HCMI-CMDC>`_.

Data sets and tables available in BigQuery from ISB-CGC are explorable through the `ISB-CGC BigQuery Table Search <https://isb-cgc.appspot.com/bq_meta_search/>`_. The file locations are available within the ``isb-cgc.GDC_metadata`` tables in BigQuery.
