About the MMRF CoMMpass
---------------

The `Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation <https://themmrf.org/>`_ (MMRF) seeks to provide resources and research for patients with multiple myeloma. MMRF began a ten-year study to track new Multiple Myeloma patients to create a rich data set which was led by researchers from the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Celgene Corp., and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. This trail was named CoMMpass.

About the MMRF CoMMpass Data
--------------------

The `CoMMpass <https://themmrf.org/we-are-curing-multiple-myeloma/mmrf-commpass-study/>`_ trial is a longitudinal observation study of 1000 newly diagnosed myeloma patients receiving various standard approved treatments. This trial aims to collect tissue samples and genetic information along with Quality of Life, disease, and clinical outcomes. CoMMpass data consists of 995 cases with RNA, whole-exome, and whole-genome sequencing data. The NCI GDC houses all the molecular characterization data with over 10,918 VCF, 6,577 BAM, 2,577 TXT, and 1718 TSV files in around 206.63 TB of data The project identification in the GDC is `MMRF-COMMPASS <https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/MMRF-COMMPASS>`_.
