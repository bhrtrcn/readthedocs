Clinical Trial Sequencing Project (CTSP) 
****************************************

For the Clinical Trials Sequencing Project (CTSP), National Cancer Institute (NCI) will utilize whole genome sequencing and/or whole exome sequencing in conjunction with transcriptome sequencing to try to identify recurrent genetic alterations (mutations, deletions, amplifications, rearrangements) and/or gene expression signatures that would be important to the hypothesis(es) submitted by the investigators. The samples will be processed and submitted for genomic characterization using pipelines and procedures established within The Cancer Genome Analysis (TCGA) project. For more information please `visit <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001175.v2.p2>`_.
