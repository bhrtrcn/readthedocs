About the NCI Center for Cancer Research
-----------------------------------------

The `NCI Center for Cancer Research <https://ccr.cancer.gov/>`_ (NCICCR) conducted a study on the Genomic Variation in Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphomas (DLBCL) through an integrative analysis of genetic lesions in 574 diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL). The study investigated genomic structural variation, genetic alteration and its effect on the development and biology of lymphomas by using high throughput sequencing, gene expression, and methylation status.

There were around 489 study subjects that were phenotyped contributing Authorized-Access, individual-level data. The Genomic Data Commons currently has around 957 controlled access BAM files available. The project identification in the GDC is `NCICCR-DLBCL <https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/NCICCR-DLBCL>`_.
