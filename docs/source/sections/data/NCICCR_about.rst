About the NCICCR-DLBCL
----------------------
The NCI Center for Cancer Research (NCICCR) conducted a study about the Genomic Variation in Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphomas (DLBCL) through integrative analysis of genetic lesions in 574 diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL). The study investigated genomic structural variation, genetic alteration and its effect on the development and biology of lymphomas by using high throughput sequencing, gene expression, and methylation status.
