About the VAREPOP
-----------------

The Research for Precision Oncology Program (RePOP) is a research activity that establishes a cohort of Veterans diagnosed with cancer and who have had genomic analyses performed on their tumor tissue as part of the standard of care. All data relevant to a patient's cancer and cancer care will be collected under RePOP, including patient demographics, co-morbidities, genomic analysis, treatments, medications, lab values, imaging studies, and outcomes. All RePOP participants will have signed/verbal informed consent and signed HIPAA authorization to have their data stored and shared from RePOP's Precision Oncology Program Data Repository (PODR). For more information please `visit <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001374.v1.p1>`_.
