About the AACR Project Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `AACR Project Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange <https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-gdc/contributed-genomic-data-cancer-research/genie>`_ contains data generated from an international pan-cancer registry to serve as an evidence base for the entire cancer community. Genomic and baseline clinical data from more than 40,000 tumors has been made available in the GDC, following the efforts of AACRâ€™s strategic and technical partners, Sage Bionetworks and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.
