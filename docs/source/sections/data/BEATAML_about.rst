About the BEATAML1.0
-------------------------------

The BEATAML1.0 data is from several studies focused on the effect of the drug Crenolanib on Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). It has been found that FLT3 mutations are associated with poor prognosis and commonly detected in AML patients. Crenolanib is a potent type I pan-FLT3 (GeneID:2322) inhibitor. It is effective against both internal tandem duplications (ITD) and resistance-conferring tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations. Usually, crenolanib monotherapy has a significant clinical benefit on AML patients that are heavily pretreated and have relapsed or were refractory but then the response will be transient and relapse occurred. The implementation of targeted therapies for acute myeloid leukemia has been challenged by complex mutational patterns within and across patients as well as a dearth of pharmacologic agents for most mutational events. 

About the BEATAML1.0 Data
------------------------------------

The BEATAML1.0 consists of over 220 files with 56 phenotyped subjects and over 3.5 TB of data. The data is made up of mainly BAM and VCF files. The majority of the data is whole-exome sequencing along with RNA Sequencing. The project identification in the GDC is `BEATAML1.0-CRENOLANIB <https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/BEATAML1.0-CRENOLANIB>`_ and `BEATAML1.0-COHORT <https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/BEATAML1.0-COHORT>`_.
