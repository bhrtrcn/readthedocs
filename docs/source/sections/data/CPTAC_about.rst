About the NCI Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium
------------------------------------------------------------
The `National Cancer Instituteâ€™s Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium <https://proteomics.cancer.gov/programs/cptac>`_ (CPTAC) is a national effort to accelerate the understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the application of large-scale proteome and genome analysis or proteogenomics.

About the NCI Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium Data Set
---------------------------------------------------------------------

CPTAC data consists of whole-genome sequencing, whole-exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and miRNA sequencing. The Genomic Data Commons (GDC) currently has controlled VCF, TSV, and BAM data available. The project identification in the GDC is `CPTAC-2 <https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/CPTAC-2>`_ and `CPTAC-3 <https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/CPTAC-3>`_.


For more information on the CPTAC data, please refer to these sites:

Data sets and tables available in BigQuery from ISB-CGC are explorable through the `BigQuery Table Search <https://isb-cgc.appspot.com/bq_meta_search/>`_. You can find the files within the ``isb-cgc.GDC_metadata`` tables in BigQuery.
