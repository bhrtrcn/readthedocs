About the CGCI
---------------

The `Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative <https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/cgci>`_ is a series of studies sponsored by the `Office of Cancer Genomics <https://ocg.cancer.gov/>`_ (OCG) at the `National Cancer Institute <https://www.cancer.gov/>`_ (NCI). This program utilizes molecular characterization to uncover distinct features of rare cancers such as HIV+ associated cancers and rare pediatric cancers. The `Burkitt Lymphoma Genome Sequencing Project <https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/cgci/projects/burkitt-lymphoma>`_ (BLGSP) is one of the projects available through `GDC <https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov>`_. It explores genetic changes in patients with Burkitt lymphoma (BL) that could lead to better prevention, detection, and treatment of this rare and aggressive cancer.

About the CGCI Data
--------------------

CGCI data consists of 23 cases with RNA sequencing, miRNA sequencing, and whole-genome sequencing data. The NCI GDC houses all the clinical, biospecimen, and molecular characterization data with over 460 VCF, 261 BAM, 123 TXT, 57 TSV, and 23 BRC XML files in around 9.1 TB of data. The project identification in the GDC is `CGCI-BLGSP <https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/CGCI-BLGSP>`_.

Data sets and tables available in BigQuery from ISB-CGC are explorable through the `ISB-CGC BigQuery Table Search <https://isb-cgc.appspot.com/bq_meta_search/>`_. The file locations are available within the ``isb-cgc.GDC_metadata`` tables in BigQuery.
