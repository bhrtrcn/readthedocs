About the CGCI
---------------

The `Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative <https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/cgci>`_ is a series of studies sponsored by the `Office of Cancer Genomics <https://ocg.cancer.gov/>`_ (OCG) at the `National Cancer Institute <https://www.cancer.gov/>`_ (NCI). This program utilizes molecular characterization to uncover distinct features of rare cancers such as HIV+ associated cancers and rare pediatric cancers. The `Burkitt Lymphoma Genome Sequencing Project <https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/cgci/projects/burkitt-lymphoma>`_ (BLGSP) is one of the projects available through `GDC <https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov>`_. It explores genetic changes in patients with Burkitt lymphoma (BL) that could lead to better prevention, detection, and treatment of this rare and aggressive cancer.

About the CGCI Data
--------------------

Some of the data available for BLGSP is RNA sequencing, miRNA sequencing, and Whole Genome Sequencing through `GDC <https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/CGCI-BLGSP>`_. More information on this data set is available from the `GDC Portal <https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/CGCI-BLGSP>`_ and the `CGCI Data Matrix <https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/cgci/data-matrix>`_ page.

Data sets and tables available in BigQuery from ISB-CGC are explorable through the BigQuery Table Search. Files can be found within the isb-cgc.GDC_metadata tables in BigQuery.
