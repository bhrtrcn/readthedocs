About Translational Research in Oncology
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `Translational Research in Oncology <https://www.trioncology.org/>`_ contains data generated from an international pan-cancer registry to serve as an evidence base for the entire cancer community. Genomic and baseline clinical data from more than 40,000 tumors has been made available in the GDC, following the efforts of AACRâ€™s strategic and technical partners, Sage Bionetworks and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. 

About the Translational Research in Oncology Data
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The TRIO data set includes masked annotations, somatic mutations, gene level copy number scores, and transcript fusion analysis. The program analyzed more than 44,000 cases. The Genomic Data Commons (GDC) currently has MAF, TXT, and TSV controlled data available.

Accessing the MP2PRT Data in Google BigQuery
------------------------------------------------

ISB-CGC has MP2PRT data, such as clinical, stored in Google BigQuery tables. Information about these tables can be found using the `ISB-CGC BigQuery Table Search <https://isb-cgc.appspot.com/bq_meta_search/>`_ with MP2PRT selected for filter PROGRAM. To learn more about this tool, see the `ISB-CGC BigQuery Table Search documentation <../BigQueryTableSearchUI.html>`_.

The MP2PRT tables are in project isb-cgc-bq. To learn more about how to view and query tables in the Google BigQuery console, see the `ISB-CGC BigQuery Tables documentation <../BigQuery.html>`_.

- Data set ``isb-cgc-bq.MP2PRT`` contains the latest tables for each data type.
- Data set ``isb-cgc-bq.MP2PRT_versioned`` contains previously released tables, as well as the most current table.
