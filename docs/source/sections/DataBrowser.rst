ISB-CGC Data Browser
***********************************

The `Data Browser <https://isb-cgc.appspot.com/cohorts/filelist/>`_ is an ISB-CGC web interface which allows you to 
explore a comprehensive selection of cancer related data files in Google Cloud Storage Buckets, such as raw sequencing, cancer nucleotide variation, pathology or radiology images.

Selecting  **Data Browser** from the **Data Browsers** drop down menu on the ISB-CGC home screen will display the **Data Browser** screen. 
Another way to get to this screen is to click on the **Launch** icon in the **Data Browser** box in the **Data Browsers** section of the ISB-CGC home page.

You will be able to use the available filters to select a set of data and download the list of this data (including barcodes and GCS locations), 
without needing to log into the ISB-CGC Web Application. Except for the ability to save output results to a Google BigQuery table or to a Google Cloud Storage Bucket (GCS), 
this screen has the same functionality as the one that you navigate to when selecting the **File Browser** button from the **Saved Cohorts** screen, 
after signing into the Web App. To learn more about this screen, see the `Cohorts File Browser documentation <webapp/Saved-Cohorts.html#file-browser>`_.

You may want to frequently reuse a cohort in multiple analyses. Creating a "saved cohort" allows you to do this. If this is the case, click on the **Login to Save New Cohort** button.
