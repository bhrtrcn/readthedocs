Data made available by the ISB-CGC through BigQuery is organized into several *open-access* 
datasets, where a dataset is made up of multiple tables.  Datasets in BigQuery are uniquely identified based on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project name (in this case **isb-cgc**), and the dataset name, separated by a colon (or a period, in standard SQL),  *eg* ``isb-cgc.TCGA_bioclin_v0``.  Tables are uniquely identified by appending the table name,
preceded by a period, *eg* ``isb-cgc.TCGA_bioclin_v0.Clinical``.
