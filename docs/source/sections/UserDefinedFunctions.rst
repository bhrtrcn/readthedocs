User Defined Functions
*********************

BigQuery now supports User Defined Functions (UDFs) in SQL and JavaScript that extend 
BigQuery on more specialized computations and that can be reused in notebooks and queries. 
To facilitate the analysis of cancer data, ISB-CGC offers a set 
of UDFs that implement commonly used statistical tests and methods in cancer research and bioinformatics. 
The UDFs are located in the ``isb-cgc-bq.functions`` data set, and the source code of the functions 
and examples of how to use them can be found `here <https://github.com/isb-cgc/Community-Notebooks/tree/master/BQUserFunctions>`_.
The following table lists all the functions avaiable in ISB-CGC.
