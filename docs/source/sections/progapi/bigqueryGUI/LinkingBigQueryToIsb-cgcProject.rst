Linking to ISB-CGC BigQuery tables
================================

Follow the images below to link the ISB-CGC BigQuery tables in projects **isb-cgc** and **isb-cgc-bq** to your Google Cloud Project. Click on image to zoom in.

When you access BigQuery from your Google Cloud Platform Console, you will see an "Add Data" box, clicking this will open a new panel on the right allowing you to either enter a project name or to select one from a list among other options.

You will now see the isb-cgc open access BigQuery tables on the left-hand side pinned to your project.
.. note:: If the data sets and tables within the project don't display immediately, refresh your screen until they do. They may take a couple of minutes to appear.
