About the ISB-CGC
*******************************


Programmatic access to ISB-CGC data and metadata is provided through ISB-CGC APIs built
on Google's OpenAPI Endpoints. A SwaggerUI interface is also available, to try out the APIs 
and view their documentation. User-generated data such as cohort definitions, and user functions such as registering 
GCP projects is also available through the ISB-CGC API Endpoints. 

**Note that all user-generated Endpoints require identity 
credentials for use.**
