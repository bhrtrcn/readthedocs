ISB-CGC APIs

About
======

There are two Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for interacting with ISB-CGC provided data. The first API, recommended for interacting with Big Query Tables is the `Google SDK <https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/>`_. ISB-CGC also provides a `Swagger API <https://api-dot-isb-cgc.appspot.com/v4/swagger/>`_, recommended for interacting with our webapp and data generated through our webapp via the command line.

Some example use-cases that the ISB-CGC API is intended to address are:

- Obtaining detailed metadata about a particular patient or sample
- Creating (or retrieving a previously saved) cohort of patients and samples
- Retrieving a cohort's file manifest using the cohort ID or specific filters
- Register, refresh, and unregister a specified Google Cloud Project

**Note that all APIs calling user-generated data require identity credentials for use.**

Authorization
=============

The ISB-CGC APIs can be used via R and python. Some of the APIs - such as the programs, samples, and cases - can be accessed without authorization. APIs that call on information saved in a users account, such as the cohorts and gcp APIs, necessarily require account information to access.

In order to access the APIs that require ISB-CGC authorization, you will need to generate a credentials file on your local machine or on your VM. To load your credentials into your command line interface:

1. Clone the ISB-CGC scripts git repository to your local machine

2. Run the isb_auth.py script either through the command line or within python

3. If you are running the ISB-CGC APIs on a VM, upload the file generated by the above process

ISB-CGC API v4.0 UI Demo
=======================

The `ISB-CGC API v4.0 UI <https://api-dot-isb-cgc.appspot.com/v4/swagger/>`_ can be used to see details about each endpoint, and also provides an interface to test endpoints.

The primary organizing principle subsetting and working with the TCGA data is a Cohort which is a list of samples. Users may create and share cohorts using the ISB-CGC web-app and then access them using the Swagger UI. (TCGA samples are identified using a 16-character “barcode” e.g. TCGA-B9-7268-01A, while patients are identified using the 12-character prefix, i.e. TCGA-B9-7268, of the sample barcode. Other datasets such as CCLE may use other less standardized naming conventions).


APIs are grouped as follows:

 - Samples
 - Cases
 - Files
 - Cohorts
 - Users


Make a Request
--------------

First, authorize your Swagger UI session with the 'Authorize' button.

Now let’s make a request:

    Expand the  `POST samples endpoint <https://api-dot-isb-cgc.appspot.com/v4/swagger/#/default/getSampleMetadataList>`_ by clicking on the ‘POST/samples’ line. 

    Click 'Try it out'

   :scale: 50
   :align: center 


.. code-block:: json

 {
 "barcodes": [
 "TARGET-52-PAJMBW-01A",
 "TCGA-WB-A81K-01Z",
 "TCGA-DX-A23U-01A",
 "CCLE-Malme-3M",
 "CCLE-Hs 863.T"
 ]
 }


After you click 'Try it out', the example value in the Request Body field becomes editable.

In the 'sample barcode value field', change string to list of samples you wish you return information on. 

Click 'Execute'

Request Response
----------------

Swagger UI submits the request and shows the curl code that was submitted. The ‘Response body’ section shows the response to the request. If you click the ‘Download’ button, you are able to download the response in JSON format.

Nuances when using the APIs
===========================


- Any special characters in the input field will cause the endpoint to fail. e.g. spacing in input box.

- Please make sure to delete all fields not being used.

- Case barcode centric endpoints only pull file paths specific to case entries.

- Sample centric endpoints pull file paths specific to sample entries.

- Cohorts made in CloudSQL(web app) will differ in sample counts from cohorts made with BigQuery tables(APIs). Samples which correspond to pathology slide images are in the CloudSQL tables but not the BigQuery tables.
