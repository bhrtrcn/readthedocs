*Democratizing access to cancer data in the cloud*

ISB Cancer Genomics Cloud (ISB-CGC) is one of three `NCI Cloud Recourses <https://datascience.cancer.gov/data-commons/cloud-resources>`_ tasked to bring together cancer data and computation power through cloud platforms. ISB-CGC is built with the Google Cloud Platform and designed to ease the access for a wide range of users allowing them to explore and analyze data sets through tools such as:

- ISB-CGC Web App
- ISB-CGC APIs
- Google BigQuery
- Google Compute Engine
- Google Cloud Storage

ISB-CGC is a collaboration between the `Institute for Systems Biology <https://systemsbiology.org/>`_ (ISB) and `General Dynamics Information Technology <https://www.gdit.com/>`_ (GDIT). ISB-CGC began in 2016 as part of the NCIâ€™s pilot cloud resource initiative to tackle the issue of the increasing amounts of cancer data and the accessibility to the data.

The ISB-CGC created a `Community Notebook <https://github.com/isb-cgc/Community-Notebooks>`_ repository to hold notebooks that use the various tools to illustrate common tasks in biological data analysis.
