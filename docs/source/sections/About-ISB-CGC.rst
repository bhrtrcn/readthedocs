*Democratizing access to cancer data in the cloud*

ISB Cancer Genomics Cloud (ISB-CGC) is one of three `NCI Cloud Recourses <https://datascience.cancer.gov/data-commons/cloud-resources>`_ tasked to bring together cancer data and computation power through cloud platforms. ISB-CGC is built with Google Cloud Platform and designed to ease access to a wide range of users allowing the data sets to be explored and analyzed through tools such as:

- ISB-CGC Web App
- Google BigQuery
- Google Compute Engine
- Google Cloud Storage

ISB-CGC is a collaboration between the `Institute for Systems Biology <https://systemsbiology.org/>`_ (ISB) and `General Dynamics Information Technology <https://www.gdit.com/>`_ (GDIT). ISB-CGC began in 2016 as part of the NCIâ€™s pilot cloud resource initiative to tackle the issue of the increasing amounts of cancer data and the accessibility to the data.
