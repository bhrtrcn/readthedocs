*Democratizing access to cancer data in the cloud*

The ISB Cancer Genomics Cloud (ISB-CGC) is one of three `National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cloud Resources <https://datascience.cancer.gov/data-commons/cloud-resources>`_ tasked with bringing cancer data and computation power together through cloud platforms. It is a collaboration between the `Institute for Systems Biology <https://isbscience.org/>`_ (ISB) and `General Dynamics Information Technology Inc. <https://www.gdit.com/>`_ (GDIT). Since starting in 2014 as part of NCI’s Cloud Pilot Resource initiative, ISB-CGC has provided access to increasing amounts of cancer data in the cloud. 

The ISB-CGC Platform enables users to bring their analysis tools to the data in the cloud, eliminating the need to download and store large data sets. Built with the Google Cloud Platform and designed to facilitate access for a wide range of users allowing them to explore and analyze data sets through tools such as:
