*Democratizing access to cancer data in the cloud*

The ISB Cancer Genomics Cloud (ISB-CGC) is one of three `NCI Cloud Recourses <https://datascience.cancer.gov/data-commons/cloud-resources>`_ tasked to bring together cancer data and computation power through cloud platforms. We are a collaboration between the `Institute for Systems Biology <https://systemsbiology.org/>`_ (ISB) and `General Dynamics Information Technology Inc. <https://www.gdit.com/>`_ (GDIT). Since starting in 2016 as part of NCIâ€™s Cloud Pilot Resource initiative, we have worked to tackle the issue of providing access to increasing amounts of cancer data in the cloud. 
The ISB-CGC is built with the Google Cloud Platform and designed to ease the access for a wide range of users allowing them to explore and analyze data sets through tools such as:

- ISB-CGC Web App
- ISB-CGC APIs
- Google BigQuery
- Google Compute Engine
- Google Cloud Storage

Additionally, to learn more about how to conduct common biological data analysis in the cloud, check out our `Community Notebook <https://github.com/isb-cgc/Community-Notebooks>`_. You will find helpful hints, suggestions and examples in both Python and R to get your analyses started on the cloud!
