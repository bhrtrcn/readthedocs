Running Workflows on ISB-CGC
*************************************

We have put together some basic documentation for ISB-CGC users who are new to the Google Cloud Platform, but your main source of information should generally be the official Google Cloud Platform `documentation <https://cloud.google.com/docs>`_.

**Getting Started with Google Cloud Platform**

 -  `Launching a Virtual Machine <gcp-info2/LaunchVM.html>`_
 -  `Creating a Google Cloud Storage Bucket <LaunchBucket.html>`_
 -  `VM Workflow Tools Installation Cheatsheet <Cheatsheet.html>`_
 -  `Workflow Cost Considerations <Workflow-Costs.html>`_

**Your First Workflows on the Google Cloud Virtual Machine**

 -  `Snakemake RNA-seq <FirstWorkflow.html>`_
 -  `CWL RNA-seq <CWL-RNAseq.html>`_
 -  `Nextflow RNA-seq <Nextflow-RNAseq.html>`_
 
**Example Workflows using public ISB-CGC data**
 
 -  `Setting Up GCSFUSE <WorkflowWithGCSFUSE.html>`_
 -  `Running Nextflow pipeline on public BAM file from ISB-CGC <RunningNextflowWithBam.html>`_
 -  `Running Snakemake pipeline on public BAM file from ISB-CGC <RunningSnakemakeWithBam.html>`_
 -  `Running CWL pipeline on public BAM file from ISB-CGC <RunningCWLWithBam.html>`_
 -  `Running WDL pipeline on public BAM file from ISB-CGC <RunningWDLWithBam.html>`_
   
 **Example Workflows using BLAST**

 - `Running Nextflow Blast <Nextflow-Blast.html>`_
 - `Running CWL Blast <CWL-Blast.html>`_
