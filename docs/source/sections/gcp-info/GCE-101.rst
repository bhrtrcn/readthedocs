Google Compute Engine
**********************

Google Compute Engine (GCE) is the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) component of Google Cloud Platform (GCP).  `GCE <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/>`_ offers scale, performance and value, letting you easily create and run virtual machines (VMs) on Google infrastructure. 

We have tried to put together some basic documentation for ISB-CGC users who are new to the Google Cloud Platform, but your main source of information should generally be the official Google Cloud Platform `documentation <https://cloud.google.com/docs>`_.
