Workflow Costs
==================

Before running your workflow, it's important to consider the factors involved in the cost. Below are some ways to watch out for costs when working on the Google Cloud.

 - Google Compute Engine charges are based on a `pricing sheet <https://cloud.google.com/compute/vm-instance-pricing>`_.
 
    - Check this periodically as pricing is routinely updated.    
   
 - The pricing is totaled up from:
 
    - Disk size 
    - Machine type memory 
    - Network Usage 
    - Price depends on the configuration 
    
 - Google provides an on site preview of costs and discounts per machine type:
 
    - `Google Platform Pricing Calculator  <https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator>`_
