Google Compute Engine (GCE) Price Make Up 
=========================================

 - GCE charges are based on a `pricing sheet <https://cloud.google.com/compute/vm-instance-pricing>`_
 
   - Check this periodically as pricing is routinely updated    
   
 - The pricing is totaled up from:
 
    - Disk size 
    - Machine type memory 
    - Network Usage 
    -  $ depends on the configuration 
    
 - Google provides an on site preview of costs and discounts per machine type
 
   - `Google Platform Pricing Calculator  <https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator>`_
