The ISB-CGC platform is built on top of the Google Cloud Platform and has been designed to make
the TCGA data as accessible as possible to a wide
range of users.  For the programmatic users, this includes *complete* access to the tools that Google
is pioneering to allow users to scale-up their analyses on the Google infrastructure using a variety of means.

The ISB-CGC documentation and the example code on github will continue to grown to provide
starting-points and use-cases designed to suit the needs of a variety of end-users.  If you 
have a particular use-case that has not yet been addressed, please contact us 
(email info@isb-cgc.org) and we will work with you to determine the best approach to 
run the analysis you have in mind.
