Accessing Controlled Data
************************************************

Information about accessing controlled data has been moved `here <../Gaining-Access-To-Controlled-Access-Data.html>`_. 

We are aware that the paper `Pathogenic germline variants in 10,389 adult cancers <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5949147/>`_ directs you to this page. ISB-CGC does not host this data; the data from this publication is available through the GDC though under their publications section as zipped files. Please visit the following page for more details: https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/PanCanAtlas-Germline-AWG
