Registering a Google Cloud Storage Bucket and a BigQuery Data Set is a prerequisite for using your own data in ISB-CGC. (Please note: The names of the buckets and data sets are case sensitive.)

**How To Register Buckets and Data sets**

**Step 1**: Click on your user icon in the upper right or **Account Details** from the drop down menu under your name.
