`Regulome Explorer <http://explorer.cancerregulome.org/>`_ is a popular web interface that allows the exploration of significant pairwise associations

any or all of the following types of high-throughput data: microRNA expression levels, copy-number alterations, DNA methylation, and somatic mutations. 
The Regulome Explorer is implemented in the following three notebook:
