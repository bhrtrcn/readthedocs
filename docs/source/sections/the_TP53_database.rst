The *TP53* Database
***********************

The *TP53* Database compiles *TP53* variant data that have been reported in the published literature since 1989 or are available in other public databases. Database releases are identified by a number.
The current is R20 (July 2019). The following data are available:

- *TP53* functional and structural data including validated polymorphisms
- *TP53* somatic variants in sporadic cancers
- *TP53* germline variants in cancer patients, families with cancers and control populations
- *TP53* gene status in human cell-lines
- Mouse models with engineered p53
- Experimentally-induced *TP53* variants

The *TP53* Database is meant to be a source of information on *TP53* variants for a broad range of scientists and clinicians who work in different research areas:

- Basic research, to study the structural and functional aspects of the p53 protein and the *TP53* gene
- Molecular pathology of cancer, to understand the clinical significance of *TP53* variants identified in cancer patients
- Molecular epidemiology of cancer, to analyze the links between specific exposures and *TP53* variant patterns in order to make inferences about possible causes of cancer
- Molecular genetics, to analyze genotype/phenotype relationships

The database includes various annotations on the predicted or experimentally assessed functional impact of *TP53* variants, clinicopathologic characteristics of tumors
and demographic and life-style information on patients. This information is useful to compile tumor-specific variant patterns and to draw hypotheses on the nature of the
molecular events involved in *TP53* mutagenesis and allows for the analysis of genotype/phenotype relationships.

Detailed information on data and annotations available is provided in the User Manual.

The ongoing project involves:

- Performing regular review of the literature on *TP53* variants
- Extracting *TP53* data from genetic and genomic databases
- Developing standard annotations of *TP53* variants
- Performing research on *TP53* variants, their patterns, origins and clinical impacts.
