The *TP53* Database
***********************

The *TP53* Database (`<https://tp53.isb-cgc.org>`_) compiles *TP53* variant data that have been reported in the published literature since 1989 or are available in other public databases. `Database releases <https://tp53.isb-cgc.org/about#database-dev-div>`_ are identified by a number.
The following data are available:

- *TP53* `functional and structural data <https://tp53.isb-cgc.org/explore_gv>`_ including `validated polymorphisms <https://tp53.isb-cgc.org/view_val_poly>`_
- *TP53* `somatic variants <https://tp53.isb-cgc.org/explore_sm>`_ in sporadic cancers
- *TP53* `germline variants <https://tp53.isb-cgc.org/explore_gm>`_ in cancer patients, families with cancers and control populations
- *TP53* `gene status in human cell-lines <https://tp53.isb-cgc.org/explore_cl>`_
- `Mouse models <https://tp53.isb-cgc.org/explore_mm>`_ with engineered p53
- `Experimentally-induced variants <https://tp53.isb-cgc.org/explore_eim>`_ of *TP53*

The *TP53* Database is meant to be a source of information on *TP53* variants for a broad range of scientists and clinicians who work in different research areas:

- **Basic research**, to study the structural and functional aspects of the p53 protein and the *TP53* gene
- **Molecular pathology of cancer**, to understand the clinical significance of *TP53* variants identified in cancer patients
- **Molecular epidemiology of cancer**, to analyze the links between specific exposures and *TP53* variant patterns in order to make inferences about possible causes of cancer
- **Molecular genetics**, to analyze genotype/phenotype relationships

The database includes various annotations on the predicted or experimentally assessed functional impact of *TP53* variants, clinicopathologic characteristics of tumors
and demographic and life-style information on patients. This information is useful to compile tumor-specific variant patterns and to draw hypotheses on the nature of the
molecular events involved in *TP53* mutagenesis and allows for the analysis of genotype/phenotype relationships.

Detailed information on data and annotations available is provided in the `User Manual <https://tp53.isb-cgc.org/help>`_.

The ongoing project involves:

- Performing regular review of the literature on *TP53* variants
- Extracting *TP53* data from genetic and genomic databases
- Developing standard annotations of *TP53* variants
- Performing research on *TP53* variants, their patterns, origins and clinical impacts.
