Programmatic Access 
*******************


APIs
============

ISB-CGC provides programmatic access to cancer data (both open and controlled-access) and metadata stored on the Google Cloud Platform through a combination of ISB-CGC APIs and Google APIs. Access to ISB-CGC metadata and user-data such as patient cohort definitions is provided through the ISB-CGC API.  For more details on Google Cloud APIs, please read the extensive in-depth Google Cloud APIs  `documentation <https://cloud.google.com/apis>`_.

Workflow Gallery
================

We have compiled a growing collection of tutorials and sample workflows designed to introduce users to running workflows (CWL,Nextflow, Snakemake, WDL) on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). ISB-CGC does not make the choice for users but instead enables as many workflow technologies as possible through documentation, support, and where necessary infrastructure.
