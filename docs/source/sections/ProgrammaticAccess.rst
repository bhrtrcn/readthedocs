Programmatic Access 
*******************


ISB-CGC APIs

ISB-CGC provides programmatic access to cancer data (both open and controlled-access) and metadata stored on the Google Cloud Platform through a combination of ISB-CGC APIs and Google APIs. Access to ISB-CGC metadata and user-data such as patient cohort definitions is provided through the ISB-CGC API described in the link below. For more details on Google Cloud APIs, please read the extensive in-depth Google Cloud documentation https://cloud.google.com/apis


Programming Environments of R and Python 

A growing set of tutorials and notebooks illustrating how you can work with ISB-CGC data stored in BigQuery BigQuery  from a variety of programming environments such as Python and R, service are provided in our Community notebook documentation page. 


Workflow Gallery 

We have compiled a growing collection of tutorials and sample workflows designed to introduce users to running workflows (Snakemake, Nextflow, WDL, and CWL) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). ISB-CGC does not make the choice for users but instead enables as many workflow technologies as possible through documentation, support, and where necessary infrastructure.
