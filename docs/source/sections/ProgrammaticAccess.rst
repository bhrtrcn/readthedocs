Programmatic Access 
*******************

Programmatic access to the data and metadata is provided through a combination of ISB-CGC APIs and Google APIs. The majority of the ISB-CGC data in BigQuery tables and in Google Cloud Storage is accessed directly via Google Cloud tools and interfaces. Access to ISB-CGC metadata and user-data such as cohort definitions is provided through the ISB-CGC programmatic API described below.

A growing set of tutorials and programming examples illustrating how you can work with these hosted data sets from a variety of programming environments such as Python and R, using Google Compute Engine VMs and the Google Genomics Pipelines (GGP) service are provided in our github repositories, also described below.

Below are tutorials and sample workflows designed to introduce users to running workflows (Snakemake, Nextflow, WDL, and CWL) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

ISB-CGC is a thin layer on top of the Google Cloud Platform. Users have at their disposal all of the tools and techologies that the Google Cloud Platform has to offer including full sudo access to Google Cloud virtual machines.

ISB-CGC does not make the choice for users but instead enables as many workflow technologies as possible through documentation, support, and where necessary infrastructure.
