Registering a Google Cloud Project
-----------------------------------
This section will show you how to register a Google Cloud Project (GCP), thereby gaining access to controlled data which you can use programmatically. Users need to have access to a Google Cloud Project to perform the steps in this section. If you don't, see the the  `ISB-CGC Quick-Start Guide <../HowToGetStartedonISB-CGC.html>`_.

To allow flexibility while working with different research teams and different processes, you can have many GCPs registered with ISB-CGC.

The instructions will walk you through how to add the necessary ISB-CGC and DCF service accounts to your project. Go to the `Google Cloud Platform <https://console.cloud.google.com/>`_ and follow these steps.
You can hide the instructions by selecting the blue **Instructions** button.  

Please be sure to add both service accounts listed below. If you don't add both service accounts you will run into issues viewing the controlled data in ISB-CGC.
Then return to the ISB-CGC Register a Google Cloud Project page, enter your Google Cloud Project ID and, click **Verify**.
