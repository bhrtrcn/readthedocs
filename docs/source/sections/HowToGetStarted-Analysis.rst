How To Get Started with Analysis
******************

This table lists multiple analysis pathways.

Interactive web-based Cancer Data Analysis and Exploration
##########################################################

*Explore and analyze ISB-CGC cancer data through a suite of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that allow users to select and
filter data from one or more public data sets (such as TCGA, CCLE, and TARGET), combine with your own uploaded data and analyze
using a variety of built-in visualization tools.*

 
.. list-table::
 
   * - **Patient Cohort Data Explorer**: Interactively create and explore cohorts of interest.
     - https://isb-cancer-genomics-cloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sections/DataExplorer.html
   * - **Interactive Pathology and Radiology Image Viewers**: View images from cancer patients seamlessly using integrated image 
   viewers.

   * - **Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)**: Interactively explore and visualize genomic data
     - https://isb-cancer-genomics-cloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sections/webapp/IGV-Browser.html
   * - **Cancer Data File Browser**:Browse and identify files associated with cohorts of interest
     - https://isb-cancer-genomics-cloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sections/webapp/Saved-Cohorts.html#file-browser
   * - **Mitelman Database for Chromosome Aberrations and Gene Fusions in Cancer**:Explore relationships between 
   chromosomal changes and cancer

Cancer data analysis using Google BigQuery
##########################################################

*Processed data are consolidated by data type (ex. Clinical, DNA Methylation, RNAseq, Somatic Mutation, etc.) and transformed
into ISB-CGC Google BigQuery tables for ease of access and analysis. This novel approach allows users to quickly analyze
information from thousands of patients in our curated BigQuery tables.*
