NIH Library Session - October 14th, 2021
========================================

We offered a half-day online bioinformatics workshop in collaboration with the NIH Library on October 14th, 2021. This workshop included a two hour interactive data science and bioinformatics component using the R statistical language and Google Cloud (BigQuery) to explore NCI genomic and proteomics (TCGA) datasets. The following outline of the interactive workshop links to Jupyter notebooks used during the training. These notebooks can be executed in Google Colab or other Jupyter environments. 

    * `Exploration of BigQuery Datasets <https://github.com/isb-cgc/Community-Notebooks/blob/master/TeachingMaterials/2021-10-NIHLibrarySession/BigQueryExploration.ipynb>`_
     
        * Select age of cases in a project
        * Characterize expression of a single gene in normal and tumor samples
        * Find annotation information for a gene
        * Find and plot all mutations in and around a gene
        * Join mutation data with survival data

    * `Large-Scale Statistical Analysis in BigQuery <https://github.com/isb-cgc/Community-Notebooks/blob/master/TeachingMaterials/2021-10-NIHLibrarySession/BigQueryCorrelations.ipynb>`_
    * `Survival Analysis in BigQuery <https://github.com/isb-cgc/Community-Notebooks/blob/master/TeachingMaterials/2021-10-NIHLibrarySession/BigQuerySurvival.ipynb>`_
    * `Introduction to BigQuery Machine Learning <https://github.com/isb-cgc/Community-Notebooks/blob/master/TeachingMaterials/2021-10-NIHLibrarySession/BigQueryMachineLearning.ipynb>`_

        * Train a classifier that uses expression profiles to predict tumor status
        * Evaluate the classifier
        * Use the classifier to predict tumor status of future samples
