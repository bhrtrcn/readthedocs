BigQuery
**********

Google BigQuery (BQ) is a a massively-parallel analytics engine ideal for working with tabular data. This includes the high-level clinical, biospecimen, and molecular data from the main NCI programs. 

Analyze patient, biospecimen, and molecular data for many cancer programs such as TCGA, TARGET, CCLE, GTEx all in ISB-CGC's BigQuery tables. 

We have also made public genomic reference databases including COSMIC, GENCODE, Kaviar, ClinVar, GO Annotations and pathway data availale as BigQuery tables. 


In this section, you'll learn how to: 

* How to invoke bash commands within a Jupyter environment.
* How to install packages/programs within a Jupyter environment
* How to use available BigQuery tables within ISB-CGC to query and identify Google Cloud Storage bucket locations for BAM files of interest
* How to use PySam to slice BAM files
* How to save slices in your bucket and retrieve them
* Brief example of working with reads

*Find BigQuery on the Google Cloud Platform
*Get started using BigQuery
*Link ISB-CGC open-access BigQuery tables to your Google Cloud Project
