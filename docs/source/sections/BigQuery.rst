BigQuery 
==============

Google BigQuery is a massively-parallel analytics engine is ideal for working with data that is essentially tabular in nature. This includes the high-level clinical, biospecimen, and molecular data from the main NCI programs. It is also where we store a large amount of metadata about files that are more appropriately stored in Google Cloud Storage, as well as genome reference sources (e.g. GENCODE, miRBase, etc.). All of these datasets and tables are completely open access and available to the research community.
