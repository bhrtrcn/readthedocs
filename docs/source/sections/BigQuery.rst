Google BigQuery (BQ) is a a massively-parallel analytics engine ideal for working with tabular data. Analyze patient, biospecimen, and molecular data for many cancer programs such as TCGA, TARGET, CCLE, GTEx all in ISB-CGC's BigQuery tables. 

We have also made public genomic reference databases including COSMIC, GENCODE, Kaviar, ClinVar, GO Annotations and pathway data available as BigQuery tables. 


In this section, you'll learn how to: 

* Find BigQuery on the Google Cloud Platform
* Get started using BigQuery
* Link ISB-CGC open-access BigQuery tables to your Google Cloud Project
