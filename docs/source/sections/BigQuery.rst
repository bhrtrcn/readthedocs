BigQuery 
==============

Google BigQuery (BQ) is a a massively-parallel analytics engine ideal for working with tabular data. This includes the high-level clinical, biospecimen, and molecular data from the main NCI programs. It is also where we store a large amount of metadata about files that are more appropriately stored in Google Cloud Storage, as well as genome reference sources (e.g. GENCODE, miRBase, etc.). All of these datasets and tables are completely open access and available to the research community.

Getting Started With BigQuery
----------------------------
The following pages will show you how to find BigQuery on the Google Cloud Platform, serve as a quick guide on how to get started and also show how to access and link ISB-CGC open-access BigQuery tables to your Google Cloud Project.
