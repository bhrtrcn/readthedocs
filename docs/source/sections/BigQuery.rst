ISB-CGC BigQuery Tables
***********************

Google BigQuery (BQ) is a massively-parallel analytics engine ideal for working with tabular data. Leveraging the power of BigQuery, we have made the information scattered over tens of thousands of XML and tabular data files in legacy and active archives at the NCI-GDC much more accessible in the form of open-access BigQuery tables. 

Using SQL in the Google BigQuery Console, in Juypter notebooks or in R, users with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) projects can analyze patient, biospecimen, and molecular data for many cancer programs such as TCGA, TARGET, CCLE, GTEx all in ISB-CGC's BigQuery tables. 

Note that dbGaP authorization is not required to access these tables.
