Cohorts are a way of creating custom groupings of the samples and/or cases that you are interested in analyzing further. 
Selecting the Data Explorer menu option on the ISB-CGC Home screen, will display the below screen. You will able to use the available filters to create a cohort, without logging into the ISB-CGC Web Application.

You may frequently re-use a cohort in multiple analyses. Creating a "saved cohort" allows you to do this. If you have any existing saved cohorts, they will appear here for you to view, edit and share.

Create a New Cohort
###################

To create a cohort from **Your Dashboard**, click on the **Create a Cohort** link in the **Saved Cohorts** panel at the bottom of the screen and select either "Filter" or the "Barcodes" from the dropdown. The Filter link will display the cohort creation page;  filters are explained below.  The Barcodes link will display a page where you can upload samples/cases barcodes and create a cohort from them. Currently you can only upload from three programs TCGA, CCLE, and TARGET. 

If you already have saved cohorts, they will be listed in the **Saved Cohorts** panel. Click on the **Saved Cohorts** link in that panel and a page that with the details of your saved cohorts will display. Alternatively, to go directly to a given cohort, click on its name and the cohort details page of that cohort will display.

These functions can also be navigated to by using the drop down options in the **COHORTS** item on the menu bar.
